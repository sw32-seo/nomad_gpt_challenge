### XZ Backdoor

In February 2024, a malicious backdoor was introduced to the Linux build of the xz utility within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 by an account using the name "Jia Tan". The backdoor gives an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key remote code execution capabilities on the affected Linux system. The issue has been given the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures number CVE-2024-3094 and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.

While xz is commonly present in most Linux distributions, at the time of discovery the backdoored version had not yet been widely deployed to production systems, but was present in development versions of major distributions. The backdoor was discovered by the software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on 29 March 2024.

### Background on XZ Utils

XZ Utils (previously LZMA Utils) is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors, including the programs lzma and xz, for Unix-like operating systems and, from version 5.0 onwards, Microsoft Windows. For compression/decompression, the Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is used. XZ Utils started as a Unix port of Igor Pavlov's LZMA-SDK that has been adapted to fit seamlessly into Unix environments and their usual structure and behavior.

### Understanding Backdoors

A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device, or its embodiment. Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems. They may be used to gain access to privileged information, corrupt or delete data, or transfer information within networks.

In the United States, the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act forced internet providers to provide backdoors for government authorities. In 2024, it was revealed that China had been tapping communications in the U.S. using that infrastructure.

Backdoors can take various forms, including hidden parts of a program, separate programs, code in firmware, or parts of an operating system. Some backdoors are deliberately installed for legitimate purposes, such as allowing manufacturers to restore user passwords. However, many systems fail to create accurate security measures, making them vulnerable to attacks.
