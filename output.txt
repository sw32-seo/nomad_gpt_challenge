# XZ Utils Backdoor

## Overview
In February 2024, a malicious backdoor was introduced to the Linux build of the xz utility within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 by an account using the name "Jia Tan". The backdoor allows an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key to execute remote code on the affected Linux system. This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2024-3094 and has a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.

## Discovery
The backdoor was discovered by software developer Andres Freund while investigating a performance regression in Debian Sid. Freund noticed unusual CPU usage and errors in Valgrind, leading to the discovery of the backdoor. The findings were publicly disclosed on March 29, 2024.

## Mechanism
The malicious code is present in the 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 releases of the XZ Utils software package. The exploit remains dormant unless a specific third-party patch of the SSH server is used. The backdoor alters the behavior of OpenSSH's SSH server daemon, allowing unauthorized access to the system.

## Response
Following the discovery, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a security advisory recommending that affected devices roll back to a previous uncompromised version. Major Linux distributions, including Red Hat, SUSE, and Debian, reverted the affected packages to older versions.

## Conclusion
The XZ Utils backdoor incident highlights the vulnerabilities in open-source software and the potential risks associated with supply chain attacks. It raises questions about the reliance on unpaid volunteers for maintaining critical software infrastructure.
